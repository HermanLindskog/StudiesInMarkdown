# Answer:
## First scenario:
*Weekly shopping for a big event.*
- Purpose/task:
The purpose of this type of grocery shopping is to make sure I have all the necessary ingredient for the upcoming event, which is new year's eve. I have planned to host a big party for my friends at home and preapare a big meal. For this event it will be approximately 15 people attending, and everybody would like to eat at my place

- Bringing shopping list with you (and using it):
I need to bring a shopping list to this grocery shopping, to make sure I manage to buy all the ingredients I need for the meal I am preparing. 

- How long do you expect it to take?
I will suppose it would take about 45 minutes from the point I am entering the grocery shop, till I leave the shop.

- How much money do you expect to spend?
I plan to spend about 4 000NOK for the meal. This amout of money is excluding drinks.

- How important it is for you to complete the task (in the store)?
It is very important to complete this task on the planned day, and the event would not take place if I cant perform the shopping at all. I have planned to do the grocery shopping two days before the acutual event, and it would work with a cry of distress to do it the day before. 

- Are you shopping alone:
I am bringing a friend that I know quite well from before, and we share a lot of similar opinions with quality and price on different things.

- Own assumptions:
For this scenario I assume that I have been to the grocery shop before, and know where I can find different things. I would also definitly bring a car for this type of scenario since it is a lot of things to shop.

## Second scenario:
*I am craving one or two things from the grocery store on a late evening, and decide to drop by the shop to buy these types of things*

- Purpose/task:
The purpose is to go in the grocery shop and just buy these few things I am craving, and go on with the rest of things I am supposed to do.

- Bringing shopping list with you (and using it):
For this event I would not bring a written shopping list, I would just have made up my mind for what I want to buy.

- How long do you expect it to take?
I would expect it to take 5 minutes from when I walk inside the store, and walk out of the store.

- How much money do you expect to spend?
It depends on what I am craving, but normally I would set a max amount of 100NOK for these types of scenarios.

- How important it is for you to complete the task (in the store)?
It is not important to do complete the task, I don't need to complete the task at all and would save money and my health it I can't do it as well.

- Are you shopping alone:
I am shopping alone

- Own assumptions:
For this event I would use the closest Joker which is very small and very few people use this grocery store to do their shopping. I have been to this shop many different times, so I know where things in the store is located.
