We need new tools for adapting IPv6
- Tunneling
	- Encapsulation of IPv6 inside IPv4 packets
- Dual stack
	- Running both IPv6 and IPv4
	- Dual stock operating systems and applications
	- Dual stack also means having dual stack network equipment, and configuring both types of addresses for new networks
- Translation
	- Only 10 percent of the Internet hosts are IPv6 enabled
	- No time left to migrate the current installed base of IPv4-only hosts to dual stack before IPv6-only hosts are deployed
